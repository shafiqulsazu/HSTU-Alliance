The *HSTU Alliance* project is a student information management system developed to streamline the way students access and 
manage their university-related details at Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University (HSTU). It simplifies the 
process of organizing and retrieving essential information such as student ID, hall, faculty, and batch. 

In real-life, such a system is crucial for both students and university administrators. For students, it provides a centralized 
platform to manage their academic and residential information, ensuring easy access to their data whenever needed. This reduces 
confusion and makes administrative tasks like hall assignments, faculty details, or batch information more efficient. For the 
university, the system minimizes manual processes, saves time, and prevents data mismanagement by digitizing and automating key operations.

Upon creating an account, students input critical details including their student ID, name, country, and hall. The login page 
requires the student ID and password for access. Once logged in, students can explore specific categories like their *Zone*,
 which displays the student's country and division, the *Hall, which shows their floor and room information, and the **Faculty*, where they can view their department (e.g., CSE, ECE, EEE). 

Each category provides a user-friendly search functionality, allowing students to easily retrieve relevant details, promoting
 efficiency in managing their student life.
